SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE

Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007

PREAMBLE

The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide 
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation 
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and 
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership 
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and 
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, 
including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or 
sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by 
derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under 
any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this 
license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their 
derivatives.

DEFINITIONS

"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s) 
under this license and clearly marked as such. This may include source files, 
build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the copyright 
statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as 
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or 
substituting - in part or in whole - any of the components of the Original

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or other 
person who contributed to the Font Software.
